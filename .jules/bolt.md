## 2025-02-18 - Sequential API Calls with Artificial Delay
**Learning:** Found a severe bottleneck in `services/github.ts` where 30 GitHub API requests were made sequentially with a 100ms delay between each, causing ~5-10s load times.
**Action:** Always check for sequential `await` loops in data fetching logic. Replaced with batched `Promise.all` (concurrency 5) to respect rate limits while improving speed by ~15x.
